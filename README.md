# Odin - Landing Page Project
## This is a demo landing page that highlights some tourist attractions in Nigeria.
This is my first ever site made with HTML and CSS. Th site is not responsive yet so please view it on a wide screen display like a laptop

Skills I learned making this:

	* Flex and Flexbox
	* CSS Pseudo-elements
	* CSS Pseudo-classes
	* Page alignment
	* (and of course) fun facts about nigerian tourism :)
